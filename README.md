### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>` tag provided is used in HTML to control the layout on mobile browsers. 

I have also improved my understanding of absolute position with the notification popup.

``
.popup {
  position: absolute;
  top: 5%;
}
``

The aspect I'm most proud of is the flexbox. Through this project, I've significantly deepened my understanding of flexbox.
